# Ajay.Nema.AI
Objective:
Provide ajay.nema.ai with the application knowledge, and it will automatically generate a foundational agent-based application. Knowledge can be provided in various formats, such as YAML, JSON, or even natural language descriptions.
ajay.nema.ai will be capable of scanning the current application database to construct a basic agentic AI-based application. This initial framework can be easily enhanced and expanded with more sophisticated business logic and rules based on application requirements. Additionally, ajay.nema.ai will enable building application-specific agents, allowing to expand and scale solution effortlessly—without any programming expertise.

This collection of intelligent AI agents can be used to build a fully agentic application. Below is a list of the core agents included in the system:

1. Gateway Agent – Listens for all incoming requests and serves as the entry point to the application.
2. Spec Manager Agent – Manages all application specifications, ensuring consistency and governance.
3. Database Manager Agent – Oversees all interactions with the database, handling queries and data integrity.
4. MySQL Agent – Facilitates interactions with MySQL databases, ensuring smooth and efficient data management.
5. Request Agent – Processes and handles incoming requests, ensuring that they are routed and executed appropriately.
