# Ajay.Nema.AI
Objective:
Provide ajay.nema.ai with the application knowledge, and it will automatically generate a foundational agent-based application for you. You can provide this knowledge in various formats, such as YAML, JSON, or even natural language descriptions.
ajay.nema.ai is capable of scanning your application database to construct a basic agent-driven architecture. This initial framework can be easily enhanced and expanded with more sophisticated business logic and rules as your needs evolve.
Additionally, ajay.nema.ai offers a flexible framework that enables the seamless integration of more agents into your application, allowing you to expand and scale your solution effortlessly—without any programming experience required.

This collection of intelligent AI agents can be used to build a fully agentic application. Below is a list of the core agents included in the system:

Gateway Agent – Listens for all incoming requests and serves as the entry point to the application.
Spec Manager Agent – Manages all application specifications, ensuring consistency and governance.
Database Manager Agent – Oversees all interactions with the database, handling queries and data integrity.
MySQL Agent – Facilitates interactions with MySQL databases, ensuring smooth and efficient data management.
Request Agent – Processes and handles incoming requests, ensuring that they are routed and executed appropriately.
